            title: 'What is the Great Lakes Watershed?',
            description: 'A watershed is an area of land where all waterways are connected and channel to a lake, system of lakes or an ocean. Watersheds show how rainfall, snowmelt, and pollutants travel through a landscape and how each organism reliant on water is connected.<br><br> The Great Lakes Watershed, also called the Great Lakes Basin, consists of Michigaming and surrounding land and waterways. Michigaming, which translates as “the vast sea” is the entity that centers Anishinaabewakiing and is known to other cartographers as a system of five lakes (Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario). The Great Lakes Watershed has been an essential part of North American life since it was formed 12,000 years ago and continues to be essential to those who live in the region. It currently supports over 3,500 variations of life and accounts for more than 20% of the earth’s fresh water.',

Those known as the “Three Fires” of this group are the Ojibwe, Potawatomi and the Odawa but other groups such as the Menominee and Meskwaki (Sac and Fox), Maa’ami and Kickapoo are also considered relatives as all the group share similar cultures and languages. As such, there are a variety of creation stories coming from those identified as Anishinaabe and all of the stories (out of respect for each other) are considered true by the Anishinaabe people. Here are some of the stories.',

But a pregnant woman asked her husband to get roots from the tree and he began to dig a hole but got scared and stopped. She was mad and went there to look and fell through the hole into a world made of water below. The water animals found the great turtle to support her and on the back of the turtle, she gave birth to twins and with the help of the muskrat she was able to get soil from the bottom of the water and with this handful of soil she created turtle island. The story continues with details of what happened with her sons and the new place she created.',

When he thought of light, it became real and he began to think of other things to bring to reality. He made trees, grass, rocks to steady the Earth but it wasn’t steady yet, so he made the four winds to tie it all down, balanced. Finally, he made four large snake-beings and threw them down to the underneath and then the Earth was balanced. Next, he made four beings in his own likeness from clay and brought them to life. They became the Thunderbird Chiefs. The Earthmaker made brothers in sets of 4 to represent the various clans and they all became the Ho Chunk, settling at the Red Banks near Green Bay.',

Anishinaabe groups have a system that operates patrilineally, clans are inherited through the father. The cardinal Ojibwe clans are Crane, Loon, Bear, Fish, Marten, Deer and Bird, (small birds) and there are many offshoots of each of these groups.  Each clan also had responsibilities to keep. Some were teaching, storytelling, medicine, and warriors. However, it was typical for the man to join the woman’s family once married (balance). One cannot marry another of the same clan as they are considered related, no matter how distantly the families are geographically located. Iroquoian groups follow a matrilineal passage of clanship, through the mother. The Ho-Chunk have a split clan system “those who are above (eagle, pigeon, thunder and warrior) and those who are below (bear, buffalo, deer, wolf, water spirit and snake) each with specific responsibilities.',
